# Requirements:
#   Inventory Example with Variables:
#     Inventory Group:
#       "DC1 Exchange"
#         "vm_vcenter: vcenter.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_datacenter: DC1"
#         "lb_api_url: 'https://dc1-kemp01.yourdomain.com/accessv2'"
#     Inventory Hosts:
#       "DC1-EXCH01.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_name: DC1-EXCH01"
#         "real_server_ip: 172.1.1.10"
#         "exchange_ignore_365_components: True"
#         "exchange_failover_target: DC1-EXCH02.yourdomain.com"
#         "lb_ignore: False"
#       "DC1-EXCH02.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_name: DC1-EXCH02"
#         "real_server_ip: 172.1.1.11"
#         "exchange_failover_target: DC1-EXCH01.yourdomain.com"
#         "lb_ignore: False"
#       "DC1-EXCHTEST.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_name: DC1-EXCHTEST"
#         "lb_ignore: True"
#         "exchange_failover_target: DC1-EXCH01.yourdomain.com"
#
#    Playbook Variables Examples:
#      connection_port: 5986
#      connection_type: winrm
#      connection_transport: kerberos
#      connection_cert_validation: ignore
#      exchange_copy_queue_limit: 10
#      exchange_replay_queue_limit: 10
#
#    Credentials Variables Examples:
#      WinRM Credentials:
#        # Notice the capitalised domain.
#        winrm_username: winrmuser@YOURDOMAIN.COM
#        winrm_password: insertpasswordhere
#      vCenter Credentials:
#        vm_vcenter_username" vcenter@yourdomain.com
#        vm_vcenter_password: insertpasswordhere
#      Kemp Credentials:
#        kemp_username" kempuser@yourdomain.com
#        kemp_password: insertpasswordhere
#
#    Optional Playbook Requirements:
#      Kerberos:
#        For Kerberos to work, you will need to create a '/etc/krb5.conf' file (see example-krb5.conf in Git Repo)
#
#  Notes:
#    - WinRM account requires Exchange Permissions (Server Management or higher)
#    - You can ignore the Kemp Real Server tasks by setting 'lb_ignore' to 'True'
#    - Exchange Copy and Replay Queue limits are the threshold that while under, this playbook will consider the database healthy.
#
#  Known Issues:
#    1: The 'win_updates' Ansible Module has some known issues where it hangs and times out.
#       Sometimes restarting the play and/or rebooting the inventory host fixes the issue, but not always.
#         ref: https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.windows/issues/516
#
#    2: I would like to put the Kemp Management into its own Ansible Role at some point.
#       I have left the (theoretical) code there (commented out) for once that is done, but in the mean time it is just a script.
#
#    3: The 'win_updates' Ansible Module has been stuggling with some Windows Updates getting stuck in an update looks.
#       This seems to be a common issue in Windows, specifically with Defender upates (this is not an issue with Ansible, but with Windows).
#       You may find you need to exclude these updates from this play.
#       You can exclude updated by KB or Description by passing the following variable to the Ansible play:
#         reject_updates:
#           - KB2267602
#           - '.*Defender.*'
