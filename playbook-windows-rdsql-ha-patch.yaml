# Requirements:
#   Inventory Example with Variables:
#     Inventory Group:
#       "DC1 RD SQL"
#         "vm_vcenter: vcenter.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_datacenter: DC1"
#     Inventory Hosts:
#       "DC1-RDSQL01.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_name: DC1-RDSQL01"
#       "DC1-RDSQL02.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_name: DC1-RDSQL02"
#
#    Playbook Variables Examples:
#      connection_port: 5986
#      connection_type: winrm
#      connection_transport: kerberos
#      connection_cert_validation: ignore
#
#    Credentials Variables Examples:
#      WinRM Credentials:
#        # Notice the capitalised domain.
#        winrm_username: winrmuser@YOURDOMAIN.COM
#        winrm_password: insertpasswordhere
#      vCenter Credentials:
#        vm_vcenter_username" vcenter@yourdomain.com
#        vm_vcenter_password: insertpasswordhere
#
#    Optional Playbook Requirements:
#      Kerberos:
#        For Kerberos to work, you will need to create a '/etc/krb5.conf' file (see example-krb5.conf in Git Repo)
#      SQL:
#        For this play to work, the WinRM user will need permissions in SQL.
#
#  Notes:
#    - Powershell Module 'SQLServer' needs to be available on each SQL Server.
#    - Dot Net 4.7.2 needed to be installed on the SQL Servers for the 'SQLServer' Powershell Mdoule to work.
#
#  Known Issues:
#    1: The 'win_updates' Ansible Module has some known issues where it hangs and times out.
#       Sometimes restarting the play and/or rebooting the inventory host fixes the issue, but not always.
#         ref: https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.windows/issues/516
#
#    2: The 'win_updates' Ansible Module has been stuggling with some Windows Updates getting stuck in an update looks.
#       This seems to be a common issue in Windows, specifically with Defender upates (this is not an issue with Ansible, but with Windows).
#       You may find you need to exclude these updates from this play.
#       You can exclude updated by KB or Description by passing the following variable to the Ansible play:
#         reject_updates:
#           - KB2267602
#           - '.*Defender.*'
